## Course 2

Our next step in the world of web development is the joy of CSS. While HTML allows us to express information through
text, images, videos, and links, CSS, on the other hand, allows us to express our creative side. This includes choices
in colors, size, formatting, and more. Since CSS, as is with the nature of self expression, is diverse, we will be
splitting its coverage into two courses. It is important to fully understand what the effects are of each attribute,
while keeping in mind how it interacts with other attributes.

### Course Long Project

Before we dive deep into CSS, let's introduce our course-long project. We will be creating a simple, yet informative
website that lists media that has had a personal impact to ourselves, whether of joy, amazement, or sheer interest.
These media works can be songs, images, movies, or games, to name a few. As this project aims to exercise our knowledge
and understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript but still provide room for self expression, pages are allowed to be in
any form. However, each media type should be located in their own page. The following is a sample of what we may want
to have in our website.

* homepage and/or about page
* movies
  * director
  * producer
  * image
  * summary
  * significance
* songs
  * title
  * artist
  * general information
  * significance
* images
  * author
  * general information
  * significance
* games
  * publisher
  * genre
  * significance

### Coloring Our World

For this course, we shall take a look at the following attributes and concepts:

* font related attributes -
  * `font-size` - change the font size of our text
  * `font-family` - choose the font family to be displayed -- see supported font families and understand failsafe fonts
  * `text-align` - align or justify our text. This can be useful when we have images or videos throughout the page
  * `color` - colors any text, including links and headers
* `background-color` - not only letters, but we can color the background too!
* `id` - we can give a specific ID to DIVs, where we expect them to be unique throughout the page, and sometimes the
           entire website
* `class` - we can apply attributes on specific classes of DIVs, this allows us to re-use similar styles in many
              places
* `<div> ... </div>` - this tag in HTML allows us to group sections of the page together. This introduces two new
                         concepts for CSS:
* `margin` - sometimes we want to add some offset for entire secions in order to prevent mushing our page with content
* `padding` - similar to margins, but keep in mind that paddings are not the entire DIV, instead they are part of the
                writeable part
