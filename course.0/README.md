## Course 0

Let's take this course to setup our environment, creating a collaborative IDE, and review the general file structure for
the following courses. We will also establish the workflow of how we can update and see our updated website.

### Fetching Template Code

Instead of starting a course with nothing, or having to rely on the progress made on previous courses, we opt in to
having templates, or rather established folders and code, that will diminish our necessary ramp-up time. Doing so will
also demonstrate how much work we have put into each course and, in necessary cases, can help us 'restart' our project.

### IDE

For a comprehensive development environment, let us choose VS Code for the following reasons:
  * it is free and (mostly) open source under the MIT License
  * large community with vast plug-ins available
  * supports out-of-the-box code recognition and auto-complete

### File Structure

Each course dealing with HTML and/or CSS will have an `index.html` file at the root, along with a `styles` folder, where
all styles will be located at. Doing so establishes an early sense of organization that will be useful towards the end
of all courses. As for JS related courses, we will primarily have our `*.js` files at the root folder, while framework
folders will have an already established structure that we can work with.

Sometimes certain courses will have a folder named `references` which, as the name suggests, may be of use as references
for what the course is trying to accomplish.
