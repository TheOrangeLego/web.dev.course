## Course 1

Let us begin our first course by taking a look into how web browsers and the Internet in general work, then creating our
first website from scratch. We will view and utilize the most commonly used element tags in HTML5, with exercises
interweaved to test and confirm our understanding of certain tags.

### Web Browsers and the Internet

When thinking of the web, we imagine our computers talking with black-boxes, often called servers, that are told what to
show on our monitors. However, it's actually your computer doing much of the work. In fact, the only thing that these
servers do to your computer is feed you files and some pieces of data. Web browsers end up doing a lot of the heavy
lifting, with some capable of doing more than other browsers, or sometimes better in general.

### Tags of Importance

* `<!DOCTYPE html>` - defines the type of document the browser is reading, in particular HTML5
* `<html></>` - root of an HTML document
* `<head></>` - section of the doc that defines metadata info
* `<title></>` - title rendered in the tab
* `<body></>` - section of the doc that defines what is rendered
* `<h[1-6]></>` - titles/headers, with the lower numbers being larger
* `<p></>` - paragraph (text)
* `<b></>` - bolding text
* `<br>` - creates as spacing break
* `<img>` - images
* `<video></>` and `<source></>` - videos with multiple sources
* `<!-- -->` - comments
* `<ol></>` and `<ul></>` ordered and unordered lists, with `<li></>` per each list item
* `<a></>` - anchor (link) that allows us to link to other documents

### References

No programmer ever works without references, and web developers are no exceptions. For that,
[W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp) provides a great list of all tags under HTML5 with both a
description and examples that can be run on your web browser.
