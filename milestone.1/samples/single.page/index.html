      <p class="heading-title">Insights of Gaming Trends in Call of Duty</p>

      <p class="heading-body">
        Over the last 2 decades, the gaming community has seen radical changes in mainstream interests and focuses,
        from difficulty boundaries, artificial intelligence expectations, feature quantity, and much more. Call of Duty,
        a current game series first released in 2003, demonstrates such varying changes, seen through its advertised
        features, and often being one of the firsts to lead such fascination.

            Capitalizing on the success of Medal of Honor (1999), Infinity Ward developed and released the first Call of
            Duty game, released on PC and XBox 360. Set in World War 2, this entry further solidified the general
            interest of shooter games set in World War 2. Considered a financial success, Infinity Ward would be called
            again by its publisher Activision to create a sequel.

            Although not the first in the industry, this Call of Duty entry brought the modern warfare shooter genre
            into the mainstream spotlight. By the time of its release, most users had experienced a fatigue of shooter
            games set in World War 2, and this entry would bring a fresh take. This would also mark the start for a new
            incoming saturation of modern warfare shooter games into the market.

            Although the fatigue for World War 2 shooters had already set in, this entry introduced a hit game mode,
            Zombies. This would also mark the beginning of Treyarch's full time collaboration into the game series,
            where they, along with Infinity Ward, would alternate development on the next Call of Duty game, allowing
            a 2 year development period.

            One of the latest releases in the series, Call of Duty: Warzone differ significantly from previous entries
            by being entirely free to play. This was potentially due to increase player base to this entry's focus on
            the battle royale game mode, popularized by other games released around this time, such as Fortnite and
            PUBG. However, this entry would further demonstrate the overall distaste on the production quality and
            patch releases in the series, especially when dealing with cheaters and hackers.
