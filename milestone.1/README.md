## Milestone 1

It has been quite a while since we have touched out web development tools, while it would be a disservice to resume
without revisiting and reviewing what has been covered. Therefore, let us take a second look at what we have learnt,
getting ourselves out of rustiness, and prepare for the next segment.

### The Internet and Us

Recall that the Internet and World Wide Web is mainly composed of computers talking to other computers. Although
historically this was done to share academic papers and small media files, we have come a long way, sharing messages,
images, videos, livestreams, and even other programs.

We see this massive network through our web browsers (mostly), showing us what others have prepared and allowing us to
interact with others in never before experienced methods. Files our browsers utilize are mainly HTML (what things to
render), CSS (how things should look), and JavaScript (how things should behave). Let us re-familiarize ourselves with
the former two before delving into the final piece.

Once we have incorporated all three into our project, we will be able to host our files onto a server and be part of the
world wide web.

### HTML - Part 1

Our first step is remembering how to use HTML. Let's use the provided HTML file named `index.html` in this directory as
a playground to test the following concepts:

* defining the base of the file, what are the `head` and `body` segments?
* headers/titles, paragraphs, and comments
* different text styles, **bolding**, *italicizing*, ~strike-through~, to name a few
* the concept of whitespacing and line breaks
* importing images
* lists
* links and multiple pages

### CSS - Part 1

Our next segment covers the core essentials of CSS, i.e. styling elements. First let us link the provided CSS file named
`styles/index.css` to our HTML file, then play around with the following concepts:

* font attributes, families, sizes, colors, alignment, weights
* background colors
* margin, padding, and border

### HTML & CSS - Part 2

The previous part may seem short, but that is only because this segment is a core essential to fully mastering web
styling. As such, we will go slowly over these concepts and merge them with the ones introduced before. Furthremore,
at this point, this is where we should be experimenting more with both old and new concepts.

HTML concepts:

* `div`
* IDs
* classes

CSS concepts:

* font and text attributes, weight, identitation, transform
* sizing and visibility, minimums, maximums, overflows
* positioning and display methods, z-index, inline, block, and flex display

### Course Long Project

And that is how much we have previously covered, with us only having mentioned our intended course long project, which
we should overview again. The goal of this project is not only to apply what we have covered for both HTML and CSS, but
to provide us with an incentive to explore what other things we can do with both tools, and, equally important,
demonstrate what can really be achieved with JavaScript. It is also one thing to have to build a website that follows a
specific template/purpose, but by having full creative freedom do we really absorve what we learn.
