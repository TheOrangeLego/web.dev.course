        The following set of pages of this website demonstrate a wider array of CSS properties that are of utmost
        interest. Although some paragraphs may have repeated text found throughout the page, what is of
        <em>highest importance</em> is the effect of the properties on each tag. For example, notice that this paragraph
        displays the following properties

        <ul>
          <li><code>border</code> - with the default of 10px dotted gray</li>
          <li class="heavy-thick"><code>font-weight</code> - the thickness is high for this line</li>
          <li><code>text-indent</code> - this paragraph starts with an indentation of 50px</li>
          <li class="capitalize"><code>text-transform</code> - we capitalize this entire line</li>
          <li>
            <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> - this paragraph has a hardcoded width of 800px and height of
            300px
          </li>
          <li><code>overflow</code> - this page shows overflow if the render window is too small by default</li>
          <li class="ellipsis"><code>text-overflow</code> - this line shows text ellipsis for a small enough line</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

        You may have thought that this was supposed to be an empty, padded spot, but I was actually hidden over here.
        Interact between the <code>visibility</code> and <code>display</code> properties. Also notice how min-max
        properties affect our rendered text in the group.

        Sometimes we can even have fun with transformations, though this requires some practice and intuitive knowledge
        of geometric and matrix based functions. If you're more interested into this, see

        Let us take a small breather, rest, and get ready to cover the funner (though more complex) side of CSS, flex
        displays. To see this in action, let us head over to <a href="gallery.html">the gallery</a>!!
